# AWS SDK for Ruby V2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/aws/aws-sdk-core-ruby?branch=master)

This library is in a developer preview period.

We are working on version 2 of the official AWS SDK for Ruby.  This library
is the first part of our v2 strategy.  AWS SDK Core is an updated set of
service clients.  Our goal is to make them more flexible and extensible
than the clients in version 1 of the Ruby SDK.

For version 1.0 of the Ruby SDK, see [aws/aws-sdk-ruby](http://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby).

## Upgrade Notes

During the preview period, there have been some minor backwards incompatible
updates between release candidates. These changes are summarized below.

### 2.0.0.rc15 Upgrading Notes

RC15 updates the `Aws::DynamoDB::Client` API operations to accept and return
simple attribute values. Prior to rc14 values were specified as:

    { s: 'string-value' }
    { n: "5.0" }

This update applies a plugin that allows users to specify values using simple
Ruby types, such as Integer, Float, Set, String, etc.

    "string-value"
    5.0

This affects **every** DynamoDB request and response structure
that accepts or returns an attribute value. To revert to the older format,
disable simple attributes:

    # disable this new default behavior
    Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new(simple_attributes: false)

**Please Note** - RC15 may be the final release candidate version prior to
a 2.0.0 final release of `aws-sdk-core`.

### 2.0.0.rc14 Upgrading Notes

RC14 simplifies the API versioning strategy. This may require small changes for
users that use the API version locking options. Also, there are minor changes
when configuring raw endpoints.

* Versioned client classes removed, e.g. `Aws::S3::Client::V20060301.new` should
  be replaced with `Aws::S3::Client.new` The `:api_version` constructor option
  is no longer accepted.

* Aws helper methods for client construction deprecated; For example,
  calling `Aws.s3` will generate a deprecation warning. Call `Aws::S3::Client.new`
  instead. Top-level helpers will be removed as of v2.0.0 final.

* When configuring an `:endpoint` directly, you must now specify the
  HTTP scheme, e.g. "http://localhost:3000", instead of "localhost:3000".
  Please note, this should only be done for testing. Normally you only
  need to configure a `:region`.

### 2.0.0.rc11 Upgrading Notes

RC 11 requires a few minor updates.  These should be the final public-facing
changes before 2.0.0 final.

* The prefered constructor for services is now using the client
  class, example:

      # deprecated, will be removed for 2.0.0 final
      Aws::S3.new

      # preferred
      Aws::S3::Client.new

* The `:raw_json` option for JSON protocol based services has been
  renamed to `:simple_json`

* The short name for Aws::SimpleDB has been renamed from `sdb` to
  `simpledb`.

## Installation

You can install the AWS SDK Core from rubygems:

    gem install aws-sdk-core --pre

If you are using Bundler, we recommend that you express a major version
dependency (this library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)):

    gem 'aws-sdk-core', '~> 2.0'

Until the final release becomes available on Rubygems, leave off the version
dependency in your Gemfile so Bundler can find it.

**Note:** AWS SDK Core requires Ruby 1.9.3+.

## Configuration

To use the Ruby SDK, you must configure a region and your AWS account
access credentials.

### Region

You can export a default region to ENV:

```
export AWS_REGION='us-west-2'
```

Or you can configure a region in code:

```ruby
# default region
Aws.config[:region] = 'us-west-2'

# per-service :region
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(region:'us-east-1')
```

### Credentials

Please take care to never commit credentials to source control.  We
strongly recommended loading credentials from an external source.  By default,
the Ruby SDK will attempt to load credentials from the following
sources:

* `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']` and `ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']`
* The shared credentials ini file at `HOME/.aws/credentials`
* From an instance profile when running on EC2

Alternatively, you can specify your credentials directly using one of the
following credential classes:

* `Aws::Credentials`
* `Aws::SharedCredentials`
* `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials`

```ruby
# default credentials
Aws.config[:credentials] = Aws::SharedCredentials.new(profile_name:'myprofile')

# per-service :credentials
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(credentials: Aws::SharedCredentials.new(profile_name:'myprofile')
```

## Basic Usage

To make a request, you need to construct a service client.

```ruby
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new
```

Each client provides one method per API operation. Refer to the
[API documentation](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sdkforruby/api/frames.html)
for a complete list of available methods.

```ruby
# get a list of buckets in Amazon S3
resp = s3.list_buckets
puts resp.buckets.map(&:name)
```

API methods accept a request params as a hash, and return structured responses.

```ruby
resp = s3.list_objects(bucket: 'aws-sdk-core', max_keys: 2)
resp.contents.each do |object|
  puts "#{object.key} => #{object.etag}"
end
```

## Paging Responses

Many AWS operations limit the number of results returned with each response.
A simple paging interface is provided that works with every AWS request.

```ruby
# yields once per response, even works with non-paged requests
s3.list_objects(bucket:'aws-sdk').each do |resp|
  puts resp.contents.map(&:key)
end
```

If you prefer to control paging yourself, all returned responses have the
same helper methods:

```ruby
# make a request that returns a truncated response
resp = s3.list_objects(bucket:'aws-sdk')

resp.last_page? #=> false
resp.next_page? #=> true
resp = resp.next_page # send a request for the next response page
resp = resp.next_page until resp.last_page?
```

The data in the response is accessible via the [data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Seahorse/Client/Response.html#data-instance_method) method which returns a struct:
```ruby
# example: request a metric from CloudWatch using get_metric_statistics
metric = cw.get_metric_statistics(
  :namespace => "AWS/Billing",
  :metric_name => "EstimatedCharges",
  :dimensions => [
    {
      :name => "ServiceName",
      :value => "AmazonS3",
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
)
puts metric.data
#<struct label="EstimatedCharges", datapoints=[#<struct timestamp=2013-11-28 17:10:00 UTC, sample_count=nil, average=nil, sum=nil, minimum=nil, maximum=1234.56, unit="None">]>
```

Refer to the 'Response Structure' tab in the documentation for each client.

## Data Iteration Examples

You can access the data in your response structs in a number of ways.
Here are a couple of examples to get you started.

S3 Bucket ACLs:
```ruby
# get a list of buckets
my_buckets = s3.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)

# iterate buckets and output the owner and permissions
my_buckets.each do |bucket|
  s3.get_bucket_acl(:bucket => bucket).grants.each do |grant|
    owner      = grant.grantee.display_name
    permission = grant.permission
    
    puts "Bucket '#{bucket}' grants user '#{owner.nil? ? "Everyone" : owner}' with '#{permission}'"
  end
end
```

S3 Bucket Logging:
```ruby
# get a list of buckets
my_buckets = s3.list_buckets.buckets.map(&:name)

# iterate buckets and check if they have logging enabled
my_buckets.each do |bucket|
  target_logging_bucket = s3.get_bucket_logging(:bucket => bucket).logging_enabled
  
  if target_logging_bucket.nil?
    puts "Bucket '#{bucket}' doesn't have bucket logging enabled."
  else
    puts "Bucket '#{bucket}' is logging to bucket '#{target_logging_bucket.target_bucket}'"+
         " in prefix '#{target_logging_bucket.target_prefix}'."
  end
end
```

Billing Estimated Charges:
```ruby
# get a billing metric
metric = cw.get_metric_statistics(
  :namespace => "AWS/Billing",
  :metric_name => "EstimatedCharges",
  :dimensions => [
    {
      :name => "ServiceName",
      :value => "AmazonS3",
    },
    {
      :name => 'Currency',
      :value => 'USD'
    }
  ],
  :start_time => Time.now - 24 * 60 * 60,
  :end_time => Time.now,
  :period => 24 * 60 * 60,
  :statistics => ["Minimum","Maximum"]
  )

metric.datapoints.each do |dp|
  puts "Over the past 24hrs our S3 cost has increased $#{(dp.maximum - dp.minimum).round(2)}"+
       " from $#{dp.minimum} to $#{dp.maximum}."
end
```


## Interactive Console

AWS SDK Core ships with a REPL that acts as an interactive console. You
can access the REPL by running `aws.rb` from the command line.

```ruby
$ aws.rb
Aws> ec2.describe_instances.reservations.first.instances.first
<struct
 instance_id="i-1234567",
 image_id="ami-7654321",
 state=<struct  code=16, name="running">,
 ...>
```

Call `#service_classes` to get a list of available service helpers and
the class they construct.

```ruby
Aws> service_clients
{:autoscaling=>Aws::AutoScaling::Client,
 :cloudformation=>Aws::CloudFormation::Client,
 :cloudfront=>Aws::CloudFront::Client,
 :cloudsearch=>Aws::CloudSearch::Client,
 ...
 :swf=>Aws::SWF::Client}
```

## Versioning

This project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). When the project
leaves the developer preview state, we will continue by versioning from
`2.0`.  Until then, all versions will be suffixed by a release candidate
version.
