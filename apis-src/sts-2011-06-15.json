Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithRoles.html\">Roles</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html\">Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access</a> in\n      <i>AWS Security Token Service</i>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The temporary security credentials that are returned from the\n      <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> response have the permissions that are\n      associated with the access policy of the role being assumed and any policies that are associated with the AWS resource being accessed. You can further\n      restrict the permissions of the temporary security credentials by passing a policy\n      in the request. The resulting permissions are an intersection of the role's access\n      policy and the policy that you passed. These policies and any applicable\n      resource-based policies are evaluated when calls to AWS service APIs are made\n      using the temporary security credentials.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the IAM role is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>Assumerole</code> by using AWS account credentials; access will be denied.
